# Pnpm workspace examples

Example code showing how to create a multi-package mono repo using pnpm.

This code accompanies my upcoming talk and blog post on pnpm. [Follow on Twitter for updates](https://twitter.com/codecapers).

To try out this code clone the code repository using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/ashleydavis/pnpm-workspace-examples.git
```

Check out the readme file in each subdirectory for instructions.

You need `pnpm` installed to run these examples:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

[See the docs for other methods to install](https://pnpm.io/installation).
